Hello! Thank you for stopping by my personal website!

My name is Meng Xu, a second year Strategy PhD student at the University of Georgia. I study strategic leadership and corporate governance, and I'm interested in research methods.

Before I made the life-changing decision to pursue a PhD, I was a Sr. Product Manager at a fintech company, leading cross-functional teams and managing a SaaS analytics platform that was adopted by enterprise customers from over fifteen countries and generated over $600M in annual revenue. I received my MBA from Georgia Institute of Technology and my BBA from the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!).

Building this website is among the many things that I’ve done to kick-start my academic career. In three years (2027), it’s going to be a perfect place to showcase my research experience and publications when I enter the job market to look for a tenure-track assistant professor position at a research university.

Please feel free to drop me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn! Have a wonderful day! <i class="fa-solid fa-coffee"></i>
