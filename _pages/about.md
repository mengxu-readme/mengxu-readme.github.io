Hello! Thank you for stopping by my personal website!

My name is Meng Xu, and I’m an aspiring PhD applicant who is eager to explore the field of Strategy and Entrepreneurship.

Before I made the life-changing decision to pursue a PhD, I was a Sr. Product Manager at a fintech company, leading cross-functional teams and managing a SaaS analytics platform that was used by data scientists from over fifteen countries and generated over half a billion annual revenue. I received my MBA from Georgia Institute of Technology and my BBA from the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!).

Building this website is among the many things that I’ve done to kick-start my academic career. In five years, it’s going to be a perfect place to showcase my research experience and publications when I enter the job market, looking for a tenure-track assistant professor position at a research university.

Please feel free to drop me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn! Have a wonderful day! <i class="fas fa-coffee"></i>
