A few years ago when I was doing my MBA at Georgia Tech, I attended a Lunch and Learn session for business PhD students because I was told that great food would be served. This was an annual event held at the business school for faculty and students to share their secrets and tips on how to do research and how to find a job. Dr. Liu, a professor in Organizational Behavior, said he blocked half day every weekend to solely focus on reading the newly published papers in his field, and he had been doing it since he was a PhD student. 

Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research papers. I’m not even a PhD student yet, but after reading a few articles from the Strategic Management Journal, I’ve already discovered why every researcher should read a lot. I don’t plan to list all the reasons why reading papers is important, and I won’t try to convince you to do what Dr Liu does every week. The purpose of this blog is to share my approach to reading a research paper as a beginner.

I always start with the abstract, introduction, and headings. Sometimes I come across a topic that I’m not interested in or that I don’t have enough knowledge to understand. After reading the abstract and introduction, I'm usually able to decide whether I should continue or not. If the answer is yes, then I’ll go through the paper with great care. Depending on the length of the paper, I usually spend more than one hour to grasp the details.

After reading a paper, I have an assignment for myself, which is to write a one-page review that summarizes the main points and my opinion of the paper. “My opinion” can be my opinion of the quality of the idea, impact of the research, limitations, etc. For example, after reading an abstract, I think about how I would execute the research. 

When I first started to read research papers, I noticed an issue – my mind shifted aways from reading quite easily. Mind-wandering in the case of reading has been characterized by task-unrelatedness, the absence of goal-directedness, stimulus-independence, unguided attention, and inward directedness ([Fabry and Kukkoonen, 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02648)). Accordingly, the solution is to make paper reading goal-oriented, attention-guided, and stimulus-independent. I find that blocking time for reading, creating a distraction-free environment, setting a goal (the one-page summary assignment), and jotting down notes help me focus and organize my thoughts and prevent mind-wandering. 

I will keep updating this how-to blog once I become a PhD student and have more experience and tips to share. Stay tuned for “My Tips for Reading a Research Paper - Advice from a PhD Student” and “My Tips for Reading a Research Paper - Advice from an Assistant Professor”.
