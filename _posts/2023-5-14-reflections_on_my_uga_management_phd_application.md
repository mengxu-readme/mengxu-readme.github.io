Back in December 2022 when I was working on my application, I told myself that if I was admitted, I would write a blog to share my PhD application experience. So here I am.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">First, Answer the Question: Why Do You Want to Do a PhD?</p>
It took me quite a few years to make the decision to do a PhD. I have worked in the industry for seven years with a very decent job and promising career path, meaning the opportunity cost for me is significant. My goal is sharp and clear: I want to be a professor at a research university. Doing research – identifying a problem and solving the problem – gives me a strong sense of self-fulfillment. I get bored easily and I want to explore new topics continuously. In academia, I’ll be able to work with the smartest people who also share the same values as I do. It’s very important to understand what I am getting myself into. Some people quit halfway through because the academic experience differs from their expectations.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Choose the Right Programs to Apply to</p>
When I was evaluating which programs to apply to, I focused on:
1. Research interest match. What are the faculty members’ areas of expertise? Do my interests align with theirs? I need to have an advisor who is a prominent scholar and who can provide guidance on how to do research in this field. 
2. Faculty research productivity. In the field of Management, we have <a href="https://www.tamugarankings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TAMUGA Rankings</a>, which aggregate publications in the eight top-tier journals in Management by Management faculty in the U.S. business schools. It’s a great resource to understand the research productivity of each management program.
3. Student placement. Placement is an indicator of the quality of the program as the objective of doing a PhD is to be placed at good research universities. It’s a great signal that a program can continuously place students as tenure track assistant professors at R1 universities.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Plan Ahead and Start Early</p>
I wish I could have started early. Taking standardized exams, connecting with professors to get recommendation letters, doing research on the programs, drafting statements of purpose… All of these tasks take a considerable amount of time if you want to do them well. I love to visualize projects, and a roadmap was one of my favorite tools when I was working in the industry as a product manager. I created an application roadmap and mapped out project tasks, milestones and deliverables on a timeline to provide a high-level visual representation of the entire application process, so I knew where I stood and whether I was on track to completion or not.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">My Application Timeline</p>
I submitted my application at the end of December. I was informed that I passed the initial screening and was invited to an online interview around mid January. I did an one hour online interview with three faculty members at the end of January. A week after the online interview, I was invited to an on-campus visit at the end of February. I met with all the Strategy faculty members and current PhD students on campus. It was quite an intense visit. Three days after the campus visit, I received the offer in email.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Reflect: What I Did Well and What I Could Have Done Better</p>
I believe that having a strong motivation and understanding the academic expectations were crucial for me to get admitted. A couple of things that I could have done better include starting early as I didn’t start until the end of the year when I was a month away from the deadline and worrying less about standard test score as it is just a component of my application profile.

I still feel very excited when I look back at my entire application journey, and I hope you find something useful from my reflections on my PhD application. Aspiring applicants, good luck and see you in academia soon!
