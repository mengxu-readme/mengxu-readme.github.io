This fall, I transformed into a conference-going whirlwind! It started with the AOM in Chicago in August, swept through the SMS in Istanbul in October, and landed at the ICGS in Tempe, Arizona, in November. While AOM and SMS might be household names for scholars, ICGS probably rings fewer bells—so let me tell you about this gem of a conference.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">What is ICGS?</p>
<a href="https://www.icgsociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The International Corporate Governance Society (ICGS)</a> is a nonprofit organization aimed to promote research, teaching, and consulting on corporate governance. This year’s annual conference took place at Arizona State University in sunny Tempe, Arizona. Thanks to a generous doctoral travel grant from the Harold S. Geneen Charitable Trust, I had the opportunity to attend.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Conference Highlights: From Keynotes to Connections</p>
I arrived in Tempe Thursday night to participate at the PDW on Friday, and the main conference ran from Saturday to Sunday. It kicked off with a keynote on corporate purpose by Dr. Cannella and Dr. Finkelstein, two prominent scholars whose research I often cite in my own work. Day two brought another stellar keynote, this time by Dr. Ertimur, who dove into shareholder voting. As someone researching both corporate purpose and shareholder voting, I couldn’t believe how perfectly these talks aligned with my interest and work—it was like the universe was winking at me. My own presentation was scheduled on Saturday afternoon. Was I nervous? Oh, absolutely. But the thoughtful feedback and questions I received made it all worthwhile.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">What Sets ICGS Apart?</p>
Several areas made the ICGS a unique conference experience.

1. Corporate Governance Focus: The focus on corporate governance means every session felt like it was tailor-made for my interests, and everything was directly relevant and enriching.

2. Interdisciplinary Spark: While corporate governance was the theme, the perspectives were far from monolithic. For example, a finance scholar presenting on CEO dismissal and performance cited a completely different body of literature than I do. It gave me fresh ideas to approach my work.

3. Global Perspectives: True to its “International” name, the conference featured discussions across US, European, and Asian contexts. I learned how Japanese boards operate and how shareholder voting systems differ in Europe and the US.

4. Theory Meets Practice: Industry practitioners shared real-world examples, including two experts who design executive compensation. Hearing their challenges reminded me how academic research can and should address practical issues.

5. Intimate Vibes: Unlike the mega-conferences where I barely scratch the surface of connections, ICGS’s smaller size fostered meaningful conversations at the sessions and breaks. I reconnected with familiar faces and met others whose work I admire but had never met in person.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Beyond the Conference: Exploring ASU and Tempe</p>
Outside of the conference, I had a little bit of time to explore the campus of Arizona State University. Walking through campus and visiting the dining halls are my go-to ways to experience campus culture. During my three-day stay, I dined at Pitchforks and Hassayampa—pretty good, though I have to say UGA’s dining halls still reign supreme! I also enjoyed running through the flat campus (you know what I mean if you’ve visited hilly UGA). On my way back to the hotel from the historic Old Main, I encountered ASU students celebrating their football victory over UCF. The Sun Devils are doing pretty well this year (currently ranked 16th). This was my first-time visiting Arizona. The desert climate, the striking vegetation, and the beautiful ASU campus made for a memorable first trip. And note to future me: pack extra lotion. My Georgia skin was not prepared for the desert dryness.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Wrapping It Up</p>
The ICGS conference was an inspiring, motivating experience that exceeded all expectations. It reminded me of why I love research and why corporate governance matters. I’m deeply grateful to the Harold S. Geneen Charitable Trust for making my participation possible.

I look forward to going back to ASU for another visit! But next time, I’ll come armed with hydration—inside and out!
