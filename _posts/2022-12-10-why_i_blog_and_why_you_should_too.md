#### Never forget a good idea
“Verba volant, scripta manent” is the motto I’ve chosen for my blog, and it’s also the one of the reasons why I blog. It is a Latin proverb which translates to "spoken words fly away, written words remain”. Periodically, I have innumerable thoughts running wildly inside my head. Sometimes a brilliant idea comes across my mind, but it’s highly possible that I’d forget about it if I decide to prioritize other work rather than jotting down the idea. I need to organize these thoughts and put them in a centralized place before they are pushed back to the back of my head, floating in the most remote realms of my mind.

#### Turn thoughts into work
For me, writing is thinking. Writing is a critical part of the creative process that sparks new ideas. 
When I write down something, even just a few bullet points, I’m more likely to keep refining the content, turning bullet points into paragraphs and eventually a presentable article. After all, the first blow is half the battle. This is especially important for researchers as we can’t wait to write until we have everything sorted out.

#### Inspire my fellows 
A blog can be a perfect outlet to share my ideas that hopefully will inspire others. I plan to share my experience and my tips on, for example, how to read and write research papers, how to collect data, and how to present research findings, and hopefully my tips will motivate others who are pursuing a similar career path. 

#### Improve writing skills
What makes writing better? Writing more! Writing papers will always be looming in the background no matter which stage I am with my academic career. The more I write, the more familiar I am with my styles and the more aware I am with my weaknesses. Writing is like exercising, and I need to keep my writing muscles toned.

#### Express myself freely
A blog is a fantastic platform to express myself. Getting stuck while writing Statement of Purpose? Write a blog to spark some ideas. Feeling burned out during the qualifying exam? Write a blog to distract myself and give myself a break. Paper submission being rejected? Write a blog to vent and get my motivation back. Emotional and physical health benefits of expressive writing have been studied by <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/sep01/keepdiary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a research published by the American Psychological Association</a>.

This is my first time writing a blog, and I’m already loving it!
