Remember me? Your friendly neighborhood PhD applicant cheerleader who hasn’t posted anything in nearly a year? It turns out that PhD life can be a bit all-consuming. Well, guess what? I’m officially a one-year PhD student veteran!</p> <p>When I was told by several applicants that my blog inspired them during their challenging PhD application journey, it hit me: OMG there are people actually reading my ramblings! Feeling a sense of responsibility, I figured I’d pay it forward and share my first-year experience to help others on a similar path.</p> <p>Disclaimer: everything I’m sharing here is based on my own adventure and may not be applicable to yours.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Coursework: Reading, Writing, and Research Methods My BFFs</p> <p>I had six content seminars (3 OB, 2 Strategy, and 1 Entrepreneurship) and three methods classes in my first year. I am a self-proclaimed OB scholar because I have taken more OB classes than Strategy classes. Reading was intense. There were about 7 papers per course per week. Writing was not easy, either. We did multiple introductions, proposal, sometimes review, and of course presentations. The research methods classes were like a twisted mental gym – challenging but strangely satisfying.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Projects: Finding My Research Groove</p> <p>I find our classes very helpful, but the real learning comes from working on projects.</p> <p>Which project should I work on? We can either be invited to join projects or propose our own and convince faculty members to hop on board. I only experienced the first route so far. When invited, I try to get the details: project status, who else is involved, and most importantly, how I can contribute.</p> <p>How many projects should I be on? I think it’s a personal choice, but genuine interest is the golden rule. Research projects can run for several years, and we won’t be able to sustain it if we are not curious and passionate.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Mentoring: The Georgia Difference</p> <p>One thing that seriously impressed me is our mentoring. We don’t select our advisors right away; instead, we are paired with a coach who helps us navigate the first year. But the support doesn’t stop there! It feels like every faculty member becomes a mentor in some way. I appreciate a junior faculty member who takes the time to suggest relevant events for me to participate in and help me plan my career. I also appreciate a senior faculty member who is always available for students. I stop by his office with the intention to schedule a meeting, but he always invites me in for a conversation right away – that’s the kind of accessibility you find at Georgia.</p> <p>At the end of our first year, we choose our advisors. I think that at the end of the first year is a good timing. I have figured out my research interests and the work styles of faculty members. I believe that selecting an advisor deserves an in-depth exploration (maybe another blog).</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Dark Side</p> <p>Let’s be honest, it’s easy to let health and self-care fall by the wayside. For me, that meant gaining some weight and neglecting exercise. Thankfully, summer break provides a much-needed reset, and I’m more physically active and slowly getting back on track. Another hurdle I faced was the learning curve. Stepping back into academia after working in the industry for many years means I’m rusty. I am not as sharp as I was ten years ago. Being a non-native English speaker definitely adds another layer to the challenge. It’s naturally more difficult to read, write, and present. If you’re rocking a PhD in your non-native language, major high five!</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">A Final Takeaway</p> <p>I’m super grateful that I’m doing my study at Georgia. Sure, the football team is amazing (Go Dawgs!), but the faculty are the real stars. They’re supportive, knowledgeable (seriously, top in the field), and incredibly generous with their time. When I compare my experience to the horror stories on the PhD subreddit, I feel like I landed in a PhD paradise. So, what’s the takeaway for aspiring PhD students? Culture, culture, culture! I encourage you to talk to current students and faculty members to get a feel for their culture before application and experience the culture yourself during campus visit. For those of you who haven’t clocked in some industry time, you might not fully grasp the importance of workplace culture. In the industry, there’s a saying: “people don’t leave jobs, they leave toxic work cultures”.</p> </div> </article> <hr style="margin-top: 3rem"> <h4 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h4> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/corporate_governance_in_the_sun_my_icgs_adventure_at_asu/">Corporate Governance in the Sun: My ICGS Adventure at ASU</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2023/reflections_on_my_uga_management_phd_application/">Reflections on My UGA Management PhD Application</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Meng Xu.
