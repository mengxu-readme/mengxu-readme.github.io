Organizations such as universities usually subscribe to journals relevant to their research. However, if you are not associated with any organizations but are interested in research papers, please keep reading this article.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Take Advantage of “Open Access” or “Free Access” Papers</p> <p>Some journals provide a few free articles in each issue. For example, Strategic Management Journal offers authors the ability to publish their articles Open Access: immediately free to read, download, and share. If a paper has the “Open Access” option, you can have access to the full text for free. This is how I had access to the first research paper that I’ve ever read.</p> <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 90%;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/open_access_research_papger-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/open_access_research_papger-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/open_access_research_papger-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/open_access_research_papger.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Open Access Research Paper" title="Open Access Research Paper" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture><figcaption class="caption">Open Access Research Paper</figcaption> </figure> </div> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Become a Member of a Professional Association</p> <p>I will use the Academy of Management (AOM) as an example. Once you become a member, you will have access to AOM’s top-ranked and peer-reviewed journals, such as Academy of Management Journal and Academy of Management Review. Additionally, you will be able attend annual meetings and events to build your network and grow as a young scholar. What makes this membership even better is that the membership fee for a student is only $99 a year.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Check Out the Author’s Academic Profile</p> <p>Some authors provide links to the full text of their research papers on their websites. It can be their faculty profiles created by the universities they work for, their personal websites, or their Google Scholar pages.</p> <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 65%;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/academic_profile-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/academic_profile-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/academic_profile-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/academic_profile.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Academic Profile" title="Academic Profile" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture><figcaption class="caption">Academic Profile</figcaption> </figure> </div> <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/google_scholar-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/google_scholar-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/google_scholar-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/google_scholar.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Google Scholar" title="Google Scholar" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture><figcaption class="caption">Google Scholar</figcaption> </figure> </div> <p style="font-weight: bold;">Reach Out to the Author Directly</p> <p>You can also reach out to the authors, tell them that you are interested in their research, and ask if they can send you a copy of the paper. I know cold-emailing someone you don’t know can be a little bit awkward. The worst case scenario is that you don’t get a response, but if you do, this conversation could be a trigger of collaboration opportunity.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="PhD"/><category term="Research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, I’d encourage you to check with your organizations.

This was an annual event held at the business school for faculty and students to share their tips on how to do research and how to find a job in academia. Dr. Liu, a professor in Organizational Behavior, said he blocked half day every weekend to solely focus on reading the newly published papers in his field, and he had been doing it since he was a PhD student.</p> <p>Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research papers. I’m not even a PhD student yet, but after reading a few articles from the Strategic Management Journal, I’ve already discovered why every researcher should read a lot. I don’t plan to list all the reasons why reading papers is important. The purpose of this blog is to share my approach to reading a research paper as a beginner.</p> <p>I always start with the abstract, introduction, and headings. Sometimes I come across a topic that I’m not interested in or that I don’t have enough knowledge to understand. After reading the abstract and introduction, I’m usually able to decide whether I should continue or not. If the answer is yes, then I’ll go through the paper with greater care. Depending on the length of the paper, I usually spend more than one hour to grasp the details.</p> <p>Now comes my favorite tip! After reading a paper, I have an assignment for myself, which is to write a one-page review that summarizes the main points and my opinion of the paper. “My opinion” can be my opinion of the quality of the idea, impact of the research, limitations, etc. Having this assignment in mind makes reading more productive because I become more conscious of what I’m reading. When I first started to read research papers, I noticed an issue – my mind shifted away from reading quite easily. Mind-wandering in the case of reading has been characterized by task-unrelatedness, the absence of goal-directedness, stimulus-independence, unguided attention, and inward directedness (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabry and Kukkoonen, 2019</a>). Accordingly, the solution is to make paper reading goal-oriented, attention-guided, and stimulus-independent. I find that blocking time for reading, creating a distraction-free environment, setting a goal (the one-page summary assignment), and jotting down notes help me focus and organize my thoughts and prevent mind-wandering.</p> <p>I will keep updating this how-to blog once I become a PhD student and have more experience and tips to share. Stay tuned for “My Tips for Reading a Research Paper - Advice from a PhD Student”.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="PhD"/><category term="Research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago when I was doing my MBA at Georgia Tech, I attended a Lunch and Learn session for business PhD students because I was told that great food would be served.

It is a Latin proverb which translates to “spoken words fly away, written words remain”. Periodically, I have innumerable thoughts running wildly inside my head. Sometimes a brilliant idea comes across my mind, but it’s highly possible that I’d forget about it if I decide to prioritize other work rather than jotting down the idea. I need to organize these thoughts and put them in a centralized place before they are pushed back to the back of my head, floating in the most remote realms of my mind.</p> <h4 id="turn-thoughts-into-work">Turn thoughts into work</h4> <p>For me, writing is thinking. Writing is a critical part of the creative process that sparks new ideas. When I write down something, even just a few bullet points, I’m more likely to keep refining the content, turning bullet points into paragraphs and eventually a presentable article. After all, the first blow is half the battle. This is especially important for researchers as we can’t wait to write until we have everything sorted out.</p> <h4 id="inspire-my-fellows">Inspire my fellows</h4> <p>A blog can be a perfect outlet to share my ideas that hopefully will inspire others. I plan to share my experience and my tips on, for example, how to read and write research papers, how to collect data, and how to present research findings, and hopefully my tips will motivate others who are pursuing a similar career path.</p> <h4 id="improve-writing-skills">Improve writing skills</h4> <p>What makes writing better? Writing more! Writing papers will always be looming in the background no matter which stage I am with my academic career. The more I write, the more familiar I am with my styles and the more aware I am with my weaknesses. Writing is like exercising, and I need to keep my writing muscles toned.</p> <h4 id="express-myself-freely">Express myself freely</h4> <p>A blog is a fantastic platform to express myself. Getting stuck while writing Statement of Purpose? Write a blog to spark some ideas. Feeling burned out during the qualifying exam? Write a blog to distract myself and give myself a break. Paper submission being rejected? Write a blog to vent and get my motivation back. Emotional and physical health benefits of expressive writing have been studied by <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/sep01/keepdiary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a research published by the American Psychological Association</a>.</p> <p>This is my first time writing a blog, and I’m already loving it!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Never forget a good idea “Verba volant, scripta manent” is the motto I’ve chosen for my blog, and it’s also the one of the reasons why I blog.
