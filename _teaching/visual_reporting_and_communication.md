#### Course Objective

This course is designed to help students become a better communicator in a work setting, especially through visual charts and graphs that turn “boring” or “confusing” data into clear, easy-to-understand insights. The specific goals and objectives are:

- To become a better business “storyteller” with data
- To gain hands on experience with data visualization tools (Excel, Tableau, etc.)
- To create high-impact charts and graphs
- To understand the differences between insights and descriptions
- To identify “right” from “wrong” in visual formatting
- To adapt messages to different audiences

#### My Role

I was an instructor for this data visualization class and was responsible for designing the curriculum, giving lectures, creating homeworks, and grading final projects.

#### Students

This was a core class for the Master of Science in Business Analytics students at Mercer University.
